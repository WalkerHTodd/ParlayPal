  <h1>Understanding Betting Odds</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>American Odds:</strong> Positive numbers show how much you'd win on a $100 bet. Negative numbers show how much you'd have to bet to win $100.</p>
    <p><strong>Implied Probability:</strong> The odds converted into the chance that something happens.</p>
    <p><strong>Expected Value (EV):</strong> A calculated value that tells you how much youâ€™d win or lose on average if you placed the same bet many times.</p>
    <p><strong>Fractional Odds:</strong> Represent the ratio of profit to stake, like 5/1 or 1/3.</p>
